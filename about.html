        	        <p class="about__text">Fresh Cut Grass is a character from campaign 3 of Critical Role, a weekly livestreamed game of Dungeon & Dragons played by a bunch of nerdy voice actors. F.C.G. is an aeormaton cleric, uses he/they pronouns, and is played by Sam Riegel.</p>

        	        <p class="about__text">Hi, nice to meet you! I’ve been a Critter for almost three years, and I started watching live for campaign 3. During the fourth episode, I had the idea for this site because of how much F.C.G. acts like a therapist. And a few months later, here we are! I really hope you enjoyed exploring this site as much as I enjoyed creating it.</p>
