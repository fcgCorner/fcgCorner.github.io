				<p class="advice__fcg">I’m here to listen, so if you want to talk, go for it! And if you don’t want to talk to me, I totally understand; it can be disconcerting to some people to tell all your problems to an aeormaton. I’m sure your friends would be just as willing to help you out.</p>
				<p class="advice__text">Even though it’s out of your control, there are still steps you can take to reduce stress or other negative feelings associated with it. You might want to reach out and talk about it with someone you trust. If no one’s available or you don’t feel comfortable doing that, try writing about it in a journal or in a notes app. The goal is to get out of your cycle of thinking and gain a new perspective on the issue, which might help reduce your anxiety about it. If you don’t achieve that right now, don’t worry; this is only one approach and won’t work for everyone or every problem.</p>
