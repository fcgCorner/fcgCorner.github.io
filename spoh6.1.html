				<p class="advice__fcg">I want you to be comfortable in your environment, so we’re going to work it out together. For Imogen, the solution for her discomfort is often to leave the environment, while for Dorian, he relies on his friends to put him at ease. Hopefully, we can brainstorm and come up with a solution that works for you.</p>
				<p class="advice__text">Take a few minutes to figure out what in your environment is making you uncomfortable.</p>

        	        <li class="advice__item">If you’re too hot, try putting on cooler clothes, turning on a fan, turning up the AC, or putting a damp cloth on your forehead.</li>
        	        <li class="advice__item">If you’re too cold, try putting on some warm clothes, using a blanket, turning up the heat, using a space heater, cooking a warm meal, or getting some exercise.</li>
        	        <li class="advice__item">If your environment is too dirty, take just five minutes to clean up your space; try putting on upbeat music while you do it to stay motivated.</li>
        	        <li class="advice__item">If you feel overwhelmed or unsafe in your environment, do your best to leave the environment. If that’s not possible, be patient with your mental health, take frequent breaks, and try playing music or other background sound with headphones.</li>
